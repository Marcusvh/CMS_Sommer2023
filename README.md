# CMS_Sommer2023
* test
## Description
I tend to have a project for sommer holiday. I do it so i keep my skills somewhat even if not improving. 
This sommer project is going to be a CMS (Content Management System), i will do the frontend in JS and using the framework Vue.js. For the backend i will use C#, REST API (C#), MS SQL. Will update this when/if i use more, if i remember... :) 

## Note
When i say [semi new for me], i mean i have done it a few times/ones before, but hardly remember it and likely was done in a different langauge and framework/template

## Overall content that i want to make
- Content Creation and Editing (CRUD)
- Content Publishing/scheduling [new for me]
- User Management and Permissions (user authentication and role-based access control) [semi new for me]
- Media Management [semi new for me]
-
